\title{Create an edge and add it to the network}
\usage{
create_edge(rv, vals, session)
}
\arguments{
\item{rv}{Local reactive values.}

\item{vals}{Parent reactive values.}

\item{session}{Shiny session object.}
}
\description{
This is different from \link{add_edge}, the later
is just involved to add a row in a dataframe.
There is a validation layer prior to knowing whether
we can add the edge. Then rv are updated and the graph
proxy is also updated.
